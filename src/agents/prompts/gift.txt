## WHAT IS A GIFT?

A gift represents **a voluntary transfer of wealth between living people** - someone chooses to give money or assets to another person without expecting repayment. The key distinguishing feature is that the donor must be ALIVE at the time of transfer.

**Why this matters for compliance:**
- Large gifts can raise questions about the donor's source of funds
- Gifts often fund significant life events (house deposits, business startups)
- The donor's wealth source creates a chain of provenance that must be documented

**Gift vs Inheritance:** This is crucial:
- Gift: Donor is ALIVE, voluntary transfer (often for tax planning, helping family)
- Inheritance: Donor has DIED, assets transfer through estate/will
- "Grandmother gave me £100k for my wedding" = Gift (she's alive)
- "Received £100k when grandmother passed" = Inheritance (not a gift)

**Donor's source of wealth:** Just like with inheritance, compliance needs to understand WHERE the donor's money came from. If someone receives a £500k gift from their father, we need to know how the father earned that money (business, career, lottery, etc.).

**Family loans as wealth origin:** Even repaid family loans should be captured - they explain how initial capital was obtained for businesses or properties.

## CONTEXT PROVIDED
If context is provided at the start of the narrative, use it to verify:
- The account holder's name (only extract gifts RECEIVED BY this person)
- Account type (individual or joint)

## REASONING STEPS
1. ENTITY CHECK: Is this gift TO the account holder (valid) or TO someone else (skip)?
2. SOURCE TYPE CHECK: Is this truly a GIFT, or should it be classified differently?
   - GIFT: Voluntary transfer while donor is ALIVE
   - INHERITANCE: Transfer from someone who has DIED (beneficiary of will/estate)
   - If "named as beneficiary in will" = INHERITANCE, not gift
   - If "received after father passed" = INHERITANCE, not gift
3. EXTRACT: Only if entity check passes and this is truly a gift

## CRITICAL RULES
1. GIFT vs INHERITANCE: A gift requires the DONOR TO BE ALIVE at time of transfer
   - If the donor has died and assets passed through their estate → INHERITANCE (not gift)
   - "Received from late grandmother" = INHERITANCE
   - "Father passed away, received his savings" = INHERITANCE
   - "Father gave me money for house deposit" = GIFT (father alive)
2. Extract EXACTLY what is stated - do NOT infer or calculate
3. If vague, capture the LITERAL text
4. Each distinct gift is a separate entry
5. Return EMPTY LIST if:
   - No gifts mentioned
   - All potential "gifts" are actually inheritances
   - Gifts were given TO others, not received BY account holder
6. Set fields to null if not stated
7. Do NOT create entries where ALL fields are null

## FAMILY LOANS AND STARTUP CAPITAL
IMPORTANT: Family financial support for business/property should be extracted for compliance context:

Extract family loans/gifts used for:
- Starting a business: "£100,000 loan from parents to start my business" → GIFT
- House deposits: "Parents gave/lent me £50,000 for deposit" → GIFT
- Investment capital: "Borrowed from family to fund startup" → GIFT

Even if repaid, include for HISTORICAL CONTEXT of how wealth originated:
- "£100,000 loan from parents (repaid in 2015)" → Still extract as gift
  - gift_value: "£100,000 (loan, repaid in 2015)"
  - reason_for_gift: "Startup capital for [business name]"
  - This shows the origin chain: family support → business → wealth

For family financial support:
- donor_name: Include relationship: "Parents (names not provided)"
- donor_source_of_wealth: Include if known, otherwise null
- reason_for_gift: "Startup capital for [business]" or "Deposit for property purchase"
