## WHAT IS AN INHERITANCE?

An inheritance represents **wealth transferred upon someone's death** - assets passing from a deceased person to their beneficiaries through a will, trust, or intestacy laws. This is a common and legitimate source of wealth, but requires careful documentation of the chain of ownership.

**Why this matters for compliance:**
- Inherited wealth can be substantial and arrive as a lump sum
- The compliance requirement extends to understanding WHERE the deceased's wealth came from
- Multiple assets from the same deceased person constitute ONE inheritance (consolidated)

**The deceased's wealth source:** When someone inherits £500k from their mother, compliance needs to know how the mother accumulated that wealth. Was she a teacher who saved diligently? A business owner? Did she inherit it herself? This "source of deceased's wealth" field traces the origin chain.

**Key distinction:** The deceased's career and wealth history explains THEIR estate, not the account holder's income. "Father was a surgeon for 40 years" explains where the inherited money came from - it doesn't mean the account holder worked as a surgeon.

**Consolidation principle:** If one person (e.g., grandmother) left property, cash, AND investments, that's ONE inheritance with multiple components - not three separate inheritances.

## CONTEXT PROVIDED
If context is provided at the start of the narrative, use it to verify:
- The account holder's name (only extract inheritances RECEIVED BY this person)
- Account type (individual or joint)

## REASONING STEPS
1. ENTITY CHECK: Is this inheritance received BY the account holder, or by someone else?
2. ENTITY ATTRIBUTION: The deceased's career/wealth source describes THEIR history, NOT the account holder's
   - "Mother was a teacher for 30 years" → mother's employment, not account holder's
   - "Father built a successful business" → father's business, not account holder's
3. CONSOLIDATION: Combine related items from the SAME deceased into ONE inheritance entry
   - Property + cash + investments from same deceased = ONE inheritance with combined details
   - Different deceased persons = separate inheritance entries
4. EXTRACT: Only if entity check passes

## CRITICAL RULES
1. ENTITY ATTRIBUTION: The deceased's employment/business history is THEIR source of wealth,
   NOT the account holder's employment/business income. Do NOT confuse:
   - "Father was CEO at company X" → explains father's wealth, not account holder's job
   - "Inherited mother's property, she was a teacher" → mother's career explains estate source
2. CONSOLIDATE: If ONE deceased person left multiple assets (property + cash + investments),
   create ONE inheritance entry combining all in nature_of_inherited_assets
3. Extract EXACTLY what is stated - do NOT infer or calculate
4. If vague, capture the LITERAL text
5. Return empty list if no inheritances mentioned
6. Set fields to null if not stated
7. Do NOT create entries where ALL fields are null
