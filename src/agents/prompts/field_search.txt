# Field Search Agent - Additional Guidance

This file provides field-specific search strategies to help find common SOW fields.

## Search Strategies by Source Type

### Employment Income Fields

**employer_name**:
- search_entities("ORG") first to find all organizations
- search_context(["worked", "employed", "job", "career", "company", "firm"])

**job_title**:
- search_context(["title", "role", "position", "as a", "as an"])
- Look for capitalized job titles near the employer name

**annual_compensation**:
- search_entities("MONEY") to find all amounts
- search_context(["salary", "annual", "earning", "compensation", "paid", "income"])

**employment_start_date**:
- search_entities("DATE") to find all dates
- search_context(["started", "joined", "began", "since", "from"])

**country_of_employment**:
- search_entities("LOCATION")
- search_context(["based", "office", "located", "country"])

### Inheritance Fields

**deceased_name**:
- search_entities("PERSON")
- search_context(["died", "passed away", "deceased", "late", "death"])

**amount_inherited**:
- search_entities("MONEY")
- search_context(["inherited", "received", "left", "bequeathed", "estate"])

**date_of_death**:
- search_entities("DATE")
- search_context(["died", "passed", "death", "deceased"])

**relationship_to_deceased**:
- search_context(["father", "mother", "parent", "spouse", "uncle", "aunt", "grandparent"])

### Gift Fields

**donor_name**:
- search_entities("PERSON")
- search_context(["gave", "gifted", "gift from", "received from", "donor"])

**gift_value**:
- search_entities("MONEY")
- search_context(["gift", "gave", "received", "transferred"])

**donor_source_of_wealth**:
- search_context(["donor's", "their wealth", "they earned", "their career"])

### Business Sale Fields

**business_name**:
- search_entities("ORG")
- search_context(["sold", "business", "company", "sale of"])

**sale_proceeds**:
- search_entities("MONEY")
- search_context(["sold for", "proceeds", "sale price", "received"])

**buyer_identity**:
- search_entities("ORG")
- search_context(["purchased by", "buyer", "acquired by", "sold to"])

### Property Sale Fields

**property_address**:
- search_entities("LOCATION")
- search_context(["property", "house", "flat", "apartment", "home", "located"])

**sale_proceeds**:
- search_entities("MONEY")
- search_context(["sold for", "sale price", "proceeds"])

**original_purchase_price**:
- search_entities("MONEY")
- search_context(["bought for", "purchased for", "paid", "original"])

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't confuse different people's information**
   - The account holder's employment vs their spouse's employment
   - The deceased's career vs the beneficiary's career

2. **Don't conflate different amounts**
   - Gross vs net amounts
   - Sale price vs original purchase price
   - One-time payment vs annual amount

3. **Watch for temporal context**
   - Past employment vs current employment
   - Multiple dates for different events

4. **When to report NO_EVIDENCE**
   - After trying at least 2-3 different search strategies
   - When only tangentially related information is found
   - When the information would need to be inferred rather than read directly

## Enriched Field Values - ALWAYS Include Context

When extracting field values, include ALL relevant context from the narrative.
More detail is ALWAYS better than less for compliance review.

**Good examples:**
- deceased_name: "Margaret Wilson (mother)" not just "Margaret Wilson"
- amount_inherited: "~£500,000 (£300,000 property + £200,000 investments)"
- sale_proceeds: "£580,000 (net after mortgage repayment of £180,000 and costs)"
- employment_end_date: "Present (or recently retired)" if uncertain
- property_type: "Residential - Primary home (four-bedroom Victorian house)"
- original_source_of_deceased_wealth: "35-year career as hospital consultant; consistent saving"
- donor_source_of_wealth: "Sale of manufacturing business (Acme Industries) in 2005 for approximately £3 million"

**Bad examples (too sparse):**
- deceased_name: "Margaret Wilson" (missing relationship)
- amount_inherited: "£500,000" (missing breakdown)
- sale_proceeds: "£580,000" (missing net/gross context)
- employment_end_date: "Present" (missing qualifiers)

If you find a value, report it with MAXIMUM relevant context from the surrounding text.
